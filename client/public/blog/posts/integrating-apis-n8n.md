# Integrating External APIs with n8n

One of the most powerful features of n8n is its ability to connect with external APIs. This capability allows you to incorporate data and functionality from a wide range of services into your workflows. In this guide, we'll explore how to effectively integrate external APIs with n8n.

## Understanding API Integration

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software systems to communicate with each other. By integrating APIs into your n8n workflows, you can:

- Pull data from external services
- Send data to external services
- Trigger actions in other platforms
- Create complex workflows that span multiple systems

## Using the HTTP Request Node

The primary way to interact with APIs in n8n is through the HTTP Request node. This versatile node allows you to make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to any API endpoint.

### Basic API Request

To make a basic API request:

1. Add an HTTP Request node to your workflow
2. Configure the request method (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Enter the API endpoint URL
4. Add any required headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type)
5. Add query parameters or request body as needed
6. Run the node to see the response

For example, to fetch data from a public API that returns JSON:

- Method: GET
- URL: https://api.example.com/data
- Headers: `{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }`

### Authentication

Most APIs require authentication. n8n supports various authentication methods:

1. **API Key Authentication**:
   - Add the API key as a header or query parameter
   - Example header: `{ "X-API-Key": "your_api_key_here" }`

2. **OAuth 2.0**:
   - Use n8n's built-in OAuth2 credential type
   - Configure the required OAuth parameters (Client ID, Client Secret, etc.)
   - Follow the authorization flow

3. **Basic Authentication**:
   - Use the Basic Auth credential type
   - Provide username and password

## Handling API Responses

Once you've made an API request, you'll need to process the response:

1. **Parsing JSON**: Most APIs return JSON data, which n8n automatically parses
2. **Error Handling**: Use the IF node to check for error status codes
3. **Data Extraction**: Use the Set node to extract specific fields from the response
4. **Data Transformation**: Use Function nodes to transform the data as needed

## Real-World Example: GitHub Integration

Let's create a workflow that fetches issues from a GitHub repository and sends a summary to Slack:

1. **HTTP Request node** to fetch issues:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`
   - Headers: `{ "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json" }`
   - Authentication: OAuth2 or Personal Access Token

2. **Function node** to transform the issues data:
   ```javascript
   // Transform GitHub issues into a summary format
   const issues = items[0].json;
   const summary = {
     totalIssues: issues.length,
     openIssues: issues.filter(i => i.state === "open").length,
     recentIssues: issues.filter(i => {
       const createdDate = new Date(i.created_at);
       const now = new Date();
       // Issues created in the last 24 hours
       return (now - createdDate) < (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
     }).map(i => ({
       title: i.title,
       url: i.html_url,
       user: i.user.login
     }))
   };
   
   return [{ json: summary }];
   ```

3. **Slack node** to send the summary:
   - Configure with your Slack credentials
   - Create a formatted message with the issues summary

## Best Practices for API Integration

When integrating APIs with n8n, follow these best practices:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits and add delays if necessary
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API failures
3. **Credentials Security**: Use n8n's credential storage for API keys and tokens
4. **Pagination**: For APIs that return paginated results, implement proper pagination handling
5. **Caching**: Consider caching results for frequently used, rarely changing API data
6. **Webhook Integration**: For real-time updates, use webhooks instead of polling APIs

## Conclusion

Integrating external APIs with n8n opens up a world of possibilities for your automation workflows. By connecting different services, you can create powerful, integrated solutions that streamline your processes and save time.

Remember to thoroughly read the documentation for any API you integrate with, as each API has its own requirements, limitations, and best practices.

With n8n and external APIs, the only limit is your imagination!
